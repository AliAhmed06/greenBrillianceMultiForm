          We at greenbrilliance.org DBA of Esolarus LLC, understand that you
          value your privacy and we strive to respect that privacy when you are
          using our services. This Privacy Policy describes what information we
          gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to
          protect it. By using the Site, you are expressly consenting to the
          information collection and use practices described in this Privacy
          Policy, as they may be amended from time to time with or without
          notice to you. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not
          use the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites
          maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link,
          who may link to us, or who may be affiliated with us in any way. We
          are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third
          party websites.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">Information We Collect From You</h5>
        <p>
          We may collect two types of information from you: Non-Personally
          Identifiable Information{" "}
          <span className="font-extrabold">Non-PII</span> and Personally
          Identifiable Information <span className="font-extrabold">PII</span>.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">What is Non-PII?</h5>
        <p>
          Non-Personally Identifiable Information does not individually identify
          you. Rather, it is anonymous technical information about users&apos; visits
          to the Site and certain other internet properties, used to evaluate
          and enhance the Site&apos;s services and to offer you products and services
          which may be relevant to you. Your Non-PII may be utilized
          individually or aggregated with other users&apos; Non-PII. Non-PII
          collected from you may include, without limitation: the IP address
          assigned to your computer or other device and other general location
          information; the type of internet browser and operating system your
          computer or other device is using; your time of visit to, and how long
          your visits lasts on, the Site; anonymous, demographic data about you,
          such as the potential age range or household income range which you
          might fall under; unique device identifiers; and other transactional
          information related to your use of the Site and certain other internet
          properties through the use of <span className="font-extrabold">cookies</span> , <span className="font-extrabold">web beacons</span>, or other
          tracking technologies, such as a session ID or your use of a
          particular online service over time and across multiple websites.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">How is Non-PII Collected?</h5>
        <p>
          Non-PII is generally collected automatically by using the Site or
          other internet services, though you may control the collection of
          certain information, such as by setting your browser to block cookies
          or by opting out of certain interest-based advertising, as described
          more fully below,in the section titled,{" "}
          <span className="font-extrabold">
            How Can You Limit the Collection and Use of Your Non-PII?
          </span>
          .
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">Is Non-PII Reidentified?</h5>
        <p>
          Yes. If utilized in an non-aggregated way, Non-PII is associated with
          an individual but it is not generally linked to any PII such that the
          identity of that individual can be reasonably determined. However, the
          Site may, from time to time, utilize information collected from the
          Site, other web properties associated with the Site, or from third
          parties in order to link Non-PII with other Non-PII, or Non-PII with
          PII, in order to personally identify you.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">What is PII?</h5>
        <p>
          By contrast, Personally Identifiable Information is information that
          does personally identify you. It includes, without limitation, your
          name, email address, physical address, phone number, and email
          address, or Non-PII that has been linked to such PII.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">How is PII Collected?</h5>
        <p>
          In order to collect PII from you on the Site, you must submit the PII
          voluntarily. If you do not want us to collect such information, you
          should not submit it to the Site. However, doing so may restrict your
          ability to use the Site. Although we do not collect PII from you on
          the Site without your consent, we may otherwise lawfully obtain
          information from reputable third parties such as companies who provide
          publicly-available information or other Non-PII which is then linked
          to your PII.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">How We Use Your Information</h5>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">Do We Use Your Non-PII Internally?</h5>
        <p>
          Yes. As touched on above, we utilize Non-PII in a number of ways.
          Typically, it is used internally in an aggregated way to analyze and
          report on the ways in which the Site is used and how we can improve
          the user experience and improve the Site&apos;s performance and services.
          We may analyze an individual user&apos;s Non-PII for the same reasons.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          Do We Share Your Non-PII With Third Parties?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes. We also share Non-PII and our findings regarding Non-PII analysis
          with our agents, affiliates, and parent companies, as well as with our
          trusted and reputable third party vendors who provide us with various
          services so that we may operate the Site and provide you with the
          Site&apos;s services <span className="font-extrabold">Vendors</span>. We use commercially reasonable efforts to
          ensure that information shared with our Vendors is subject to a
          confidentiality agreement between us and the Vendor, and that it is
          consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our online advertising partners
          do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address,
          telephone number or other personally identifiable information from us,
          without your consent. They may, however, use persistent identifiers to
          anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their
          networks beyond these Sites (see the section below titled, <span className="font-bold">Do We
          Engage in Marketing, Interest-Based Advertising, and Retargeting?</span> ).
          Such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be
          able to personally identify you, unknown to us.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          Do Third Parties Have Their Own Collection and Use Practices?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes. Certain Vendors provide data, analytics, and marketing services
          (such as Google Analytics, an ad server, or a third party marketing
          partner) and may employ their own technologies for collection of
          information on the Site. While a Vendor may not generally implement a
          collection technology without our consent, we do not control the
          Vendors&apos; technologies, how they may be used, or the information they
          may collect, and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or
          the content of the Vendors. Please visit the sites of those businesses
          to review their privacy policies.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">Do You Use Cookies?</h5>
        <p>
          Yes. Non-PII may be stored on your computer in the form of a <span className="font-bold">cookie</span>.
          Cookies enable the Site to <span className="font-bold">personalize</span> itself for each user in order
          to make the Site operation more efficient and user friendly. For
          example, a cookie may reduce the time it takes for pages to load on
          your computer.Our Vendors may also use cookies or other tracking
          technologies as described above. We or our Vendors may, for example,
          use cookies to track the performance of advertising services provided
          by our Vendors.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">What Information Do Cookies Collect?</h5>
        <p>
          A <span className="font-bold">session</span> cookie will store information about your activity on the
          Site until the browser is closed, at which point the session cookie
          may be deleted. A cookie may also store information about your
          activity on the Site beyond the closing of the browser, such as by
          storing your password or other information so that you don&apos;t have to
          re-enter it each time. Typically, our cookies will expire after 30
          days of inactivity.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          Do We Engage in Marketing, Interest-Based Advertising, and
          Retargeting?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes. We, our Vendors, or Partners (defined in the section below
          titled, <span className="font-bold">Do We Share Your PII With Third Parties?</span> ) may set a cookie
          on your device to provide you with interest-based or <span className="font-bold">targeting </span>
          advertising. Such tactics may include tracking your use of a web
          service over time and across different websites, in what is known as
          <span className="font-bold"> retargeting</span> which is a type of interest-based advertising.
          Retargeting means that after visiting the Site, third parties may
          deliver ads to you on other websites based on your interest in, or
          activity on this Site. Conversely, you may be shown ads on this Site
          based on your interest in, or activity on, third parties&apos; websites.Our
          advertising partners do not have access to or use your PII from us,
          without your consent, except as otherwise provided herein. As
          discussed above, they may track your Internet usage across other
          websites and combine data from other sources to personally identify
          you, outside of our knowledge and control.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">Do We Use Your PII Internally?</h5>
        <p>
          Yes. Without limiting other potential uses, we may, but are not
          required to use your PII in the following ways: communicate with you
          about your account or transactions with us and send you information
          about features and enhancements on or to the Site; communicate with
          you about changes to this Privacy Policy; send you newsletters, offers
          and promotions for our products and services, third party products and
          services, or special events by email, text, or other another medium,
          either by us or by our vendors; administer contests, giveaways,
          promotions, and polls; and detect, investigate, and prevent activities
          that may violate our policies or be illegal.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          Do We Share Your PII With Third Parties?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes. We may use your PII for any lawful purpose. For example, We may
          need to share your PII with our Vendors who provide services to us so
          that we can operate the Site and provide the Site&apos;s services. Such
          Vendors may not utilize your PII for any other purpose, and their use
          of your PII is subject to their confidentiality agreement with Us. We
          may also share, sell, rent, or license your PII to other third
          parties, such as advertisers and marketers, for the purpose of
          providing their products and services to you <span className="font-bold">Partners</span>.If You
          subsequently decide that you no longer want Partners to utilize Your
          PII, You will have to communicate Your request directly with Partners,
          as We do not have control over their policies or business practices.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          May We Assign Your Information to Another Company?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes. In the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for
          example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of
          a sale of assets or a bankruptcy, we may transfer any of your
          information to the new party in control or the party acquiring assets.
          Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the
          acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy
          Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, we
          cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will
          have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as
          described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          Are There Other Circumstances Under Which We Might Share Your
          Information?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes. There are other circumstances under which we might share your
          information, generally when there is a legal issue or when attempting
          to resolve a dispute. We may disclose any of your information to third
          parties: when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law,
          including without limitation, by contract, search warrant, subpoena,
          or court order; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
          suspected or actual prohibited activities, including without
          limitation,fraud, situations involving potential threats to the Site
          or the physical safety of any person or the public, or violations of
          applicable law; to protect our and third party rights; and to
          communicate with service providers who may assist us in responding to
          your inquiries, requests, or disputes.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          Your Choices and Control Over the Collection and Use of Your
          Information
        </h5>
        <p>
          We believe you should have choices about the collection, use, and
          sharing of your information. Although you cannot opt-out of all data
          collection, you can limit the collection, use, and sharing of some of
          your information.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          How Can You Limit the Collection and Use of Your PII?
        </h5>
        <p>
          As stated above, if you do not wish for us or third parties to collect
          your PII, you should not submit PII into the Site. The very nature of
          some of the services the Site offers requires your PII. Therefore, if
          you do not submit PII you may not be able to use the associated
          services. You may also email admin@greenbrilliance.org to request
          access or changes to your PII; however, you will not be permitted to
          examine the PII of any other person or entity and may be required to
          provide us with PII to verify your identity prior to accessing any
          records containing information about you. We may not accommodate a
          request to change or delete PII information if we believe doing so
          would violate any law or legal requirement, or cause the information
          to be incorrect.

        <h5 className="font-semibold">
          Opting Out of Email Marketing Communications
        </h5>
        <p>
          You may opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us by
          sending an email to admin@greenbrilliance.org or by following the
          opt-out link in the emails you receive. Upon your opt-out, please
          allow up to 10 business days for the opt-out to go into effect. Please
          note that you may not be able to opt-out of transactional
          communications which are required as a part of your account but which
          are not meant to offer you products or services. Also note that our
          Vendors or Partners may send you email marketing communications or
          advertising offers through other mediums. Your opt-out request to us
          may not affect whether third parties continue to market to you. In
          those scenarios, please contact those companies directly.

          How Can You Limit the Collection and Use of Your Non-PII?
        </h5>
        <p>
          There are several ways you may limit the collection and use of your
          Non-PII. First, you may modify your browser&apos;s cookie settings. Most
          web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can
          usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If
          you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline
          cookies, some features of the Site may not work or may not work as

          Your browser or device may include <span className="font-bold">Do Not Track</span> functionality.
          Because a <span className="font-bold">Do Not Track</span> compliance protocol has not yet been
          finalized, our information collection and disclosure practices, and
          the choices that we provide to customers, will continue to operate as

          Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising
        </h5>
        <p>
          As described above, we, our Vendors, or our Partners may engage in
          what is known as interest-based or targeted advertising. You may opt
          out of the collection of your information for purposes of
          interest-based advertising. For more information about interest-based
          ads, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/. To opt out of your
          web browsing information being used in this manner, please visit
          http://optout.aboutads.info. This opt-out process is managed and
          governed by industry self-regulatory bodies such as the Digital
          Advertising Alliance (http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/), not by
          us. Note that in the opt-out process, you may opt-out of
          interest-based advertising on a company-by-company basis, or you may
          opt out of interest-based ads from all companies who have elected to
          participate in the program. Although some companies may provide their
          own, direct opt-out mechanism, this Site does not currently offer that
          option. If you do elect to take advantage of this opt-out, it
          remembers your preference by setting a cookie on your device or
          browser. Therefore, if you change computers or browsers, or delete
          cookies, you will have to opt-out again for each of the companies you
          previously opted out of. It is also important to note that opting-out
          of interest-based ads does not mean that you will no longer receive
          advertising, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based
          advertising from third parties that do not participate in these
          programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based
          advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by
          their policies and choice mechanisms.

          Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
        </h5>
        <p>
          To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights
          described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by
          sending us an email to admin@greenbrilliance.org. Only you, or a
          person registered with the California Secretary of State that you
          authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
          request related to your personal information. You may also make a
          verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. <br />
          You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data
          portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
          request must:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-[20px]">
          <li>
            Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
            an authorized representative.
          </li>
          <li>
            Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
            properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
          information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
          request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will
          only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer
          request to verify the requestor&apos;s identity or authority to make the
          request.
        </p>

        <h5 className="font-semibold">Response Timing and Format</h5>
        <p>
          We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within
          forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to
          ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension
          period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or
          electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only
          cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request&apos;s
          receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we
          cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability
          requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information
          that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
          information from one entity to another entity without hindrance,
          specifically by electronic mail communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
          consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
          unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
          tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
          estimate before completing your request.
        </p>
