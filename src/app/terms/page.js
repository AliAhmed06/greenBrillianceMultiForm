        <h5 className="font-semibold">22. ADVERTISING DISCLOSURES</h5>
        <p>Typical bill savings estimates are based on 20-year savings with a 5kW solar system. These estimates assume a utility inflation rate of 2.2% and assume 84% percent of needs met by solar panels. The electricity rates used are state averages as of September of 2016 (according to EIA). Ownership of the solar system and panels is also assumed. Typical savings may vary according to roof, shading, and other home properties.</p>
        <p>A consumer&apos;s eligibility to have the costs of their solar installation covered in their state will depend on their tax liability. The Federal ITC is a 30 percent tax credit (as of 2019) on residential (under Section 25D) and commercial (under Section 48) properties that is available in states across America (see https://www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-investment-tax-credit-itc). The average cost of installing solar in terms of labor is around 10% of system costs* and can vary by state, project scope, and installation company. In most cases, a consumer will have more than enough credit to cover the cost of their solar installation provided they have enough tax liability to take advantage of the ITC.</p>
        <p>*A typical or average size of a solar system is about 5kW (about 15-25 panels) and typically costs around $30,000. This amount can vary tremendously by state and the project scope. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) estimates that the average cost of labor for a solar projeCt is around $0.59/W, which is generally around 10% of the total cost to install a solar system (assuming a solar system and installation cost of $6.19/W). This means that the average cost to install a typical sized solar system should be around $3,000. These estimates are subject to change as technological breakthroughs are constantly bringing the cost of solar lower and lower.</p>
        <p>A consumer&apos;s eligibility to get paid to install solar will also depend on rebates and incentives available in their state, their utility company, and tax liability. Eligible users can receive payments in the form of $/watt of solar installed (depending on their utility provider), in the form of a monetary payment for projects that are within a certain scope (i.e., Maryland will pay you $1,000 it you install a solar system smaller than 20 kW at your primary residence and use a solar installer with a NABCEP certification), in the form of monetary compensation, or otherwise, from utility providers that offer net metering programs, or in the form of a credit on your income taxes (provided you have enough tax liability to take advantage). All payments are subject to terms, eligibility, and availability and can change over time.</p>
